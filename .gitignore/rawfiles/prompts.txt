Create individual webpage for each bug

On the bugs view, when clicking a bug button/picutre, it is supposed to link to a new webpage/view that shows the following things:
1. the original picture of the bug button/picture as clicked.
2. The data fetched from Biterdata.json, that matched the Keywords column using the name of the clicked bug picture/button. The name of the clicked picture/button should be stripped off any file extension such as .jpg and .png.
Right now two Keywords "bed_bug" and "black_widow" should be available, once updates finished, track and make sure these two bugs can be found and data can be fetched.


right now it is showing "No descriptive data found for this item" in both bed_bug and black_widow picture. When clicking these buttons. Check why no data is fetched when clicking bed_bug.png button and black_widow.png button.

There is an error in convert-biters-csv.ps1 When converting csv to json, do not replace "_" with " "




The json file is generated correct. However, when clicking the bed_bug.png picture/button, the page should search in Biterdata.json, and search the keyword bed_bug and find it in the json file. It should locate two sections: characteristics and health concern. It is now showing "No descriptive data..." This is wrong and should be fixed.

This still didn't fixe the issue.
